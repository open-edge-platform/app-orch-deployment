# Skupper Client Modifications

We have modified the Skupper client code, originally hosted at [Skupper client], to enforce a robust
cryptographic algorithm and address Kubernetes dependency issues.
These enhancements ensure improved security and compatibility,
making the client more reliable and efficient for our specific use cases.
