## Skupper Client Modifications 
We have modified the Skupper client code, originally hosted [Skupper client](https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper/tree/v1/client), to enforce a robust cryptographic algorithm and address Kubernetes dependency issues. These enhancements ensure improved security and compatibility, 
making the client more reliable and efficient for our specific use cases.
